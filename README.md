## Overview

`mat2qubit` is a Python package for converting matrix operators into a Pauli operator representation. Single particles/subsystems as well as interacting particles (e.g. many-body Hamiltonians) may be processed. More formally, the code takes sums of tensor products of arbitrarily sized matrices, and maps them to sums of Pauli products with a chosen encoding. The code assumes trivial (i.e. bosonic etc) commutation, meaning that it cannot be used for fermionic particles.

The package can be used to implement different encodings for which there are often depth-space tradeoffs or other resource tradeoffs (see references below). The built-in encodings include <b>standard binary</b>, <b>Gray code</b>, <b>unary (one-hot)</b>, and <b>block unary</b>. User-defined embeddings may be added by modifying `integer2bit.py`. This package is a partial implementation of the "discrete quantum intermediate representation" (DQIR) developed in reference [2] below.

The first version of this code was developed at Intel Labs in Santa Clara, California.

`mat2qubit` is currently maintained by Azulene Labs.

## Installation

We recommend one of two installation options:

### Option 1
`python setup.py bdist_wheel`  
`pip install dist/*.whl`

### Option 2
In your `.bash_profile` include the path to the `mat2qubit` directory in `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH`.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, please install with dev dependencies:

`python -m pip install '.[dev]'`

To ease the pain of keeping the code style consistent, you can use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com), with the provided `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

In order to run tests please run:

`python -m unittest mat2qubit/*_TEST.py`
